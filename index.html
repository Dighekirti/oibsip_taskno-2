    <div class="life">
        <p>Shivaji Bhonsale I , also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
             Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the 
             Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad FortOver the course of his life, Shivaji 
             engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European
             colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a
             Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived
             ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian 
             in court and administration.
             Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on increased 
             importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of 
             the Hindus.<br>

        <h3>Father of Indian Navy.</h3>
            <p>Shivaji realized the importance of naval force in its early stages and built a powerful navy. He believed that it would help him keep foreign 
            invaders-- Dutch, Portuguese and British-- and pirates at bay. Shivaji Maharaj built naval forts at Jaigarh, Vijaydurg, Sindhudurg and many other 
            places and even had four different types of warships including Manjuhasm Pals, Gurabs and Gallibats. He is known as the father of the Indian Navy.</p>
